## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variable provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? 

The two variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are vehicle length and ground clearance.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?
The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10^-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?

The model is statistically significant, and can predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. According to the calculated r-squared value, 71% of the variables explain the outcome we are trying to predict.
